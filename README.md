# MRR-for-neuromorphic-computing
The work was done by the following sequence:
1. In the file 'Solution to equations' the linear and nonlinear systems were solved, the solutions to nonlinear system were stored.
2. In the file 'Read and analyse data' the solution to nonlinear system was analysed and the nonlinearity was found.
3. In the file 'P_out Vs P_ins approximation' the nonlinearity was approximated for further implementation in CNN model.
4. In the file 'CNN with custom activation function' a CNN with nonlinearity as a custom activation function was built.
